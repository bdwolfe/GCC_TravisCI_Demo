# GCC_TravisCI_Demo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bdwolfe/GCC_TravisCI_Demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bdwolfe/GCC_TravisCI_Demo)

This repository is a simple example of using TravisCI to run Python unit tests in response to repository changes. The build status badge should indicate failure, since some of the unit tests should fail on Python 3.x.
